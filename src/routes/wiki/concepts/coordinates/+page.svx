# Coordinates

Coordinates in Minecraft are represented by an `x`, `y`, and `z` value. They are used to represent positions of
entities, blocks, particles, sounds and more. In commands, they are represented as simply `x y z`, where `x`, `y`, and
`z` are decimal numbers representing the coordinates on each axis.

Block coordinates are locked to the grid and are unique - there can only be one block per set of coordinates. Block
coordinates are whole numbers, for example you can have a block at `123 86 94` but not `123.7 86.2 94.6`. Entities are
not locked to the grid - they can be at decimal positions (and usually are).

`x.0 y.0 z.0` represents the bottom left corner of a block, not the centre. The centre of a block would be represented
by the coordinates `x.5 y.5 z.5`.

:::info
Every command and function in Minecraft is always executed at a position. This is usually the world spawn. You
can change this using the commands "execute at" or "execute positioned".

### Examples

- `/setblock 123 86 94 minecraft:pink_concrete`: In this `setblock` command, we tell the game to put a pink concrete
  block at the coordinates `123 86 94`.
- `/tp @s 66.2 98 45.7`: This command would teleport the current entity to the exact coordinates `66.2 98 45.7`

## Relative Coordinates

Using the symbols `~` and `^`, we can reference coordinates relative to the current coordinates (for example, you can
get the position `7 blocks above the current position`).

`~` represents the current position on any axis. For example, `12 ~ 76` would teleport me to `x=12` `z=76` but keep `y`
as the current position. The coordinates `~ ~ ~` would represent the position of the command - this is useful to do
something at the current position such as placing a block or summoning an entity.

The `~` symbol can be followed by a number to include an offset to the current position. For example, `~ ~12 ~` would
represent the current position offset by 10 blocks on the y-axis (or in simpler terms: the position 10 blocks above
the current position). This can also be a negative number.

Similarly `^` represents a relative position, taking into account the current rotation too. The most common use for this
is to get a position in front of the direction of rotation. For example, you can use `^ ^ ^5` to get the position 5
blocks in front of the current position in whatever direction the command or entity is rotated.

- `^3 ^ ^` represents a vector 3 blocks perpendicular of the head (sway)
- `^ ^3 ^` represents a vector 3 blocks "above" of the head (heave)
- `^ ^ ^3` represents a vector 3 blocks in front of the head (surge)
