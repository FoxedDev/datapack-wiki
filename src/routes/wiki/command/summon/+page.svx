# /summon command

The `/summon` command is used to summon an entity at a position, along with any entity NBT.

## Syntax

The syntax of the `/summon` command is as follows:

```
summon <entity> [position] [nbt data]
```

- `<entity>`: an ID of a minecraft entity. For example: `minecraft:cow`, `marker`, `zombie`. If the namespace
  (`minecraft:`) is omitted, it will default to the `minecraft` namespace.
- `[position]` (optional): the [coordinates](/wiki/concepts/coordinates) at which the entity should be spawned.
  (Defaults to the current position).
- `[nbt data]` (optional): a compound containing the NBT (in [SNBT format](/wiki/nbt/snbt)) which the entity should be
  spawned with. For example: `{NoAI:1b}`.

## Examples

- `summon minecraft:cow` - Summons a cow at the current position.
- `summon minecraft:ender_dragon ~ ~50 ~` - Summons an ender dragon 50 blocks above the current position
- `summon minecraft:wither 29 372 121` - Summons a wither at the coordinates `x=29, y=372, z=121`
- `summon minecraft:zombie ~ ~ ~ {NoAI:1b}` - Summons a zombie at the current position with the `NoAI` NBT, meaning it
  will not move around or attack players.

## Alternatives

The `execute summon <entity>` command can also be used to summon an entity. Using this
[execute subcommand](/wiki/command/execute) will summon an entity at the current position, and then run the specified
command as the newly summoned entity.

However, `execute summon` cannot provide any NBT to give the entity upon being spawned. You will have to edit the nbt in
the command/function which is executed, which can be a bit tedious. An alternative to
`execute summon minecraft:cow run function custom_function` would be the following:

```mcfunction
summon minecraft:cow ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["newly_summoned_cow"]}
execute as @n[type=cow,tag=newly_summoned_cow] at @s run function custom_function
tag @n[type=cow,tag=newly_summoned_cow] remove newly_summoned_cow
```
