# /function command

This command runs any `.mcfunction` file when called. You can also pass in a NBT compound or NBT source path if the
function is a macro function. All functions are run independently and one after another - for example, if you run
`function1` and then `function2`, then `function2` will only run once `function1` has finished.

## Syntax

- **`function <namespace>:<function>`**: Runs the `.mcfunction` file at `data/<namespace>/function/<function>`
- **`function <namespace>:<function> {key:value}`**: Runs the `.mcfunction` file at
  `data/<namespace>/function/<function>`, and uses the `{key:value}` if the function is a macro function.
- **`function <namespace>:<function> with (block <targetPos>|entity <target>|storage <id>) <path>`**: Runs the
  `.mcfunction` file at `data/<namespace>/function/<function>`, and uses the NBT source if the function is a macro
  function.

:::tip
You can stop a function running in real-time using the return command.
