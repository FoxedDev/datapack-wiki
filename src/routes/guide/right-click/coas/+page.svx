# Carrot on a Stick Right Click Detection

Using a carrot on a stick (or a warped fungus on a stick) is perhaps one of the simplest methods of right-click
detection, requiring only a single tick command and a scoreboard. This method works due to the `used:carrot_on_a_stick`
statistic detecting right clicks on any `carrot_on_a_stick` item.

:::info
For the sake of simplicity, we will use a carrot on a stick, **shortened to COAS**. This method also works with
warped fungus on a stick (WFOAS) items.
:::

COAS and WFOAS items have a unique property that means that right clicking the item counts as "using" an item, and will
therefore increase the `used:carrot_on_a_stick` statistic. We can track changes to this statistic using a scoreboard.
When it goes up, we know that the player has right clicked a COAS, and we can run a command when that happens.

## Method

To get started, we need to create a scoreboard with the criteria `minecraft.used:minecraft.carrot_on_a_stick`, so that we can
later detect when a player uses the COAS (by right clicking on it).

If you don't already have it, you'll need to create a load function with a command that creates a new scoreboard
objective. You can name the objective whatever you want. We recommend naming it something like `<namespace>.rc_coas`. In
your load function, put a **scoreboard command** such as this:

```mcfunction:load.mcfunction
scoreboard objectives add <namespace>.rc_coas minecraft.used:minecraft.carrot_on_a_stick
```

This scoreboard will go up by 1 **every time a player right clicks a COAS** - when this happens we can execute our
function. Note that this command must run every tick, otherwise it won't be able to detect right clicking. Put this in
your tick/loop function:

```mcfunction:tick.mcfunction
# This will run the "rc_run" function as the player who uses the COAS.
execute as @a[scores={<namespace>.rc_coas=1..}] run function <namespace>:rc_run
scoreboard players reset @a[scores={<namespace>.rc_coas=1..}] <namespace>.rc_coas
```

In the `rc_run.mcfunction` file, you can do whatever you like as a result of right clicking the COAS. As an
example, putting this in `rc_run.mcfunction` will make the player say `Used COAS` when they right click a COAS
item.

```mcfunction:rc_run.mcfunction
say Used COAS
```

### Detecting specific items
The above method will detect when any carrot on a stick item is right clicked, which by itself isn't useful. Instead, we want to detect when a specific carrot on a stick item is clicked.

We can give our carrot on a stick item a special `custom_data` component which is unique to our custom item. The `custom_data` component can support any NBT data, but the simplest value would be `{item:"my_custom_item"}`:
```mcfunction
# Give the player the custom item
give @s carrot_on_a_stick[custom_data={item:"my_custom_item"}]
```

Then, we can just add an extra check to our `execute` command in `tick.mcfunction` to only run the function when the player is holding our custom item:
```mcfunction:tick.mcfunction
# Replace the previous execute command in tick.mcfunction with this:
execute as @a[scores={<namespace>.rc_coas=1..}] if items entity @s weapon.mainhand carrot_on_a_stick[custom_data~{item:"my_custom_item"}] run function <namespace>:rc_run
# If you want more than one custom item, simply copy the above command, and just change "my_custom_item"
```
